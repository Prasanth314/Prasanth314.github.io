                    Describing myself is like reading an empty notebook.
                    Speaking formally I am an average student trying to better myself.
                    My home town is Kurnool,Andhra Pradesh. I did my schooling at KRTS kurnool.
                    Completed my graduation from SNIST Hyderabad.
                    Currently I am pursuing my Masters at IIIT Hyderabad.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My hobbies are watching movies. I would like to hang out more.

                <h3>A comparative study between Hungarian and Antcolony optimization algroithm for task scheduling in Cloud</h3>
                <p>
                    cloud computing is upcoming and evolving technologies in this era. Using cloud the capital
                    expenditure is reduced. Many companies move towards cloud to reduce capital expenditure and
                    operational cost. Task scheduling is the process of allocating tasks to the resources available. There are
                    different types of task scheduling algorithms. In this paper, we use Hungarian method to allocate tasks
                    to the resources, and compare with ant colony optimization. We also check the time and space
                    complexities.

                <h3>
                    Classifying Fake News Articles Using Machine Learning Techniques
                </h3>
                <p>
                    News is important in daily life as it informs our view to the world and in response, we take actions and
                    make choices in various aspects. Gradually, the tendency
                    towards online news is increasing as it is more concise
                    and is available at the finger tips. There has been large
                    generation of deceptive content worldwide that has an
                    effect on the formation of opinions, making decisions
                    and voting trends. Most of the 'fake news' is initially
                    circulated through social media networks such as
                    Twitter, Facebook, and then makes the way into
                    mainstream media outlets such as Radio and TV. The
                    fake news articles share linguistic features such as heavy
                    use of quoted material. In this use case, the results of
                    fake news detection test and the performance of fake
                    news classifiers is discussed. The aim is to build a new
                    fake news detector using classifiers like Logistic
                    Regression, Decision tree classification, Multinomial
                    Naive Bayes classification.
